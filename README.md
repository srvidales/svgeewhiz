# svg-whiz
  
## Description
CLI application that allows you to generate SVG files based on one of 3 shapes, circle triangle and square. You can also add text and select the color for both shape and text. This is a very simple challenge to showcase OOP. Namely how the 3 shapes extend the base Shape class. It also makes use of Jest in order to provide a way to test the app.

This is the solution to the UC Berkeley Extensions coding boot camp module 10 challenge.
The challenge itself can be
